# 🚀 Go Learning for Backend Engineers

A comprehensive, interactive Go learning project designed specifically for backend engineers. This repository provides hands-on examples, detailed comments, and practical demonstrations of Go programming concepts with a focus on backend development.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

### Core Go Concepts
- **Variables & Data Types**: Declarations, type inference, constants, and iota
- **Control Structures**: If/else, switch statements, for loops, and range operations
- **Collections**: Arrays, slices, maps, and nested data structures
- **Functions**: Basic functions, variadic functions, closures, and error handling
- **Structs & Interfaces**: Object-oriented patterns, composition, and polymorphism

### Backend Engineering Focus
- **HTTP Servers**: Building REST APIs with Go's net/http package
- **Middleware**: Authentication, CORS, logging, and rate limiting
- **Concurrency**: Goroutines, channels, select statements, and worker pools
- **Patterns**: Producer-consumer, pipeline, context cancellation
- **Real-world Examples**: JSON handling, database patterns, configuration management

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.19+ installed ([Download Go](https://golang.org/dl/))
- Basic programming knowledge
- Understanding of backend development concepts

### Installation & Running

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rishabh21g/go_learning.git
   cd go_learning
   ```

2. **Run the interactive learning application:**
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

3. **Or build and run:**
   ```bash
   go build
   ./go_learning
   ```

## 📚 Learning Modules

### 1. 🏗️ Basic Syntax & Data Types
Learn fundamental Go syntax including:
- Variable declarations (var, :=, multiple assignments)
- Built-in data types (integers, floats, strings, booleans)
- Constants and iota for enumerations
- Type inference and explicit typing

### 2. 🔄 Control Structures & Collections
Master Go's control flow and data structures:
- Conditional statements (if/else, switch)
- Loops (for, range, while-style)
- Arrays vs slices (dynamic arrays)
- Maps (key-value pairs)
- Nested collections and practical examples

### 3. ⚙️ Functions & Error Handling
Understand Go's approach to functions:
- Function declarations and parameters
- Multiple return values
- Named returns and variadic functions
- Go's error handling patterns
- Methods and receivers
- Higher-order functions and closures

### 4. 🏛️ Structs & Interfaces
Learn object-oriented patterns in Go:
- Struct definition and initialization
- Methods with value and pointer receivers
- Interface definition and implementation
- Composition over inheritance
- Empty interfaces and type assertions
- JSON marshaling/unmarshaling

### 5. 🌐 Backend HTTP Server
Build web servers and APIs:
- HTTP server creation and routing
- Request handling and response formatting
- Middleware patterns (logging, CORS, auth)
- RESTful API design
- JSON APIs and error responses
- Rate limiting and security patterns

### 6. 🚦 Concurrency & Goroutines
Master Go's concurrency model:
- Goroutines and lightweight threads
- Channels for communication
- Select statements for channel operations
- Worker pools and producer-consumer patterns
- Context for cancellation and timeouts
- Pipeline patterns and fan-out/fan-in

## 💡 Key Features

### Interactive Learning
- **Menu-driven interface**: Choose which concepts to explore
- **Hands-on examples**: Every concept includes runnable code
- **Progressive difficulty**: Start simple, build to complex patterns
- **Real-world focus**: Examples based on actual backend scenarios

### Comprehensive Comments
- **Detailed explanations**: Every line of complex code is explained
- **Best practices**: Learn Go idioms and conventions
- **Common patterns**: See how experienced Go developers structure code
- **Performance tips**: Understand when and why to use different approaches

### Backend-Focused Examples
- **HTTP server patterns**: Learn to build scalable web services
- **Database interactions**: Patterns for data persistence
- **API design**: RESTful services and JSON handling
- **Microservices patterns**: Configuration, logging, health checks
- **Concurrency patterns**: Handle multiple requests efficiently

## 🎓 Learning Path

### Beginner (Start Here)
1. Run the interactive application: `go run main.go`
2. Choose "Basic Syntax & Data Types" to start
3. Work through "Control Structures & Collections"
4. Practice with "Functions & Error Handling"

### Intermediate
1. Explore "Structs & Interfaces" for OOP concepts
2. Study "Backend HTTP Server" for web development
3. Try building your own simple HTTP API

### Advanced
1. Master "Concurrency & Goroutines"
2. Experiment with the full demo (option 7)
3. Combine concepts to build a complete backend service

## 🔧 Code Examples Highlights

### Variable Declarations
```go
// Multiple ways to declare variables
var name string = "Go Programming"
language := "Go"  // Short declaration
var (
    projectName = "go_learning"
    isOpenSource = true
)
```

### HTTP Server with Middleware
```go
// Server with middleware chain
server := &http.Server{
    Addr:    ":8080",
    Handler: loggingMiddleware(corsMiddleware(authMiddleware(handler))),
}
```

### Concurrency Patterns
```go
// Worker pool pattern
for w := 1; w <= numWorkers; w++ {
    go worker(w, jobs, results)
}
```

## 🛠️ Development

### Running Individual Modules
You can also run individual packages to focus on specific concepts:

```bash
# Test basic syntax
go run basics/*.go

# Test functions
go run functions/*.go

# Test concurrency examples
go run concurrency/*.go
```
