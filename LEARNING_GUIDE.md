# üìö Go Learning Guide for Backend Engineers

This guide provides a structured learning path through the Go programming language with a focus on backend development concepts.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By completing this course, you will:
- Master Go syntax and core language features
- Understand Go's approach to error handling and concurrency
- Build HTTP APIs and web services
- Implement common backend patterns
- Write concurrent and scalable code

## üìã Prerequisites

- Basic programming experience (any language)
- Understanding of backend/web development concepts
- Familiarity with HTTP, REST APIs, and JSON
- Command line usage

## üó∫Ô∏è Learning Path

### Phase 1: Go Fundamentals (2-3 hours)

#### Step 1: Basic Syntax & Data Types
**Goal**: Learn Go's type system and variable declarations

**Topics Covered**:
- Variable declaration methods (`var`, `:=`, multiple assignments)
- Built-in data types (int, float, string, bool, etc.)
- Constants and `iota` for enumerations
- Type inference vs explicit typing

**Practice Exercise**:
```bash
make run-basics
# Then select option 1 in the interactive menu
```

**Key Takeaways**:
- Go is statically typed but supports type inference
- Zero values are important in Go
- Constants are compile-time evaluated

#### Step 2: Control Structures & Collections
**Goal**: Master Go's control flow and data structures

**Topics Covered**:
- Conditional statements (`if/else`, `switch`)
- Loops (`for`, `range`)
- Arrays vs Slices (dynamic arrays)
- Maps (key-value pairs)
- Nested collections

**Practice Exercise**:
```bash
# Run control structures examples
# Select option 2 in the interactive menu
```

**Key Takeaways**:
- Slices are more common than arrays
- Maps are reference types
- Range loops are idiomatic Go

### Phase 2: Functions & Error Handling (2-3 hours)

#### Step 3: Functions & Methods
**Goal**: Understand Go's approach to functions and methods

**Topics Covered**:
- Function declarations and parameters
- Multiple return values
- Named returns and variadic functions
- Methods with receivers
- Higher-order functions

**Practice Exercise**:
```bash
make run-functions
# Focus on error handling patterns
```

**Key Takeaways**:
- Multiple return values are common
- Error handling is explicit, not exception-based
- Methods are functions with receivers

### Phase 3: Object-Oriented Patterns (2-3 hours)

#### Step 4: Structs & Interfaces
**Goal**: Learn Go's approach to object-oriented programming

**Topics Covered**:
- Struct definition and initialization
- Interface definition and implementation
- Composition over inheritance
- Empty interfaces and type assertions
- JSON marshaling/unmarshaling

**Practice Exercise**:
```bash
make run-structs
# Pay attention to interface examples
```

**Key Takeaways**:
- Interfaces are implicitly implemented
- Composition is preferred over inheritance
- Empty interfaces can hold any type

### Phase 4: Backend Development (3-4 hours)

#### Step 5: HTTP Servers & APIs
**Goal**: Build web services and REST APIs

**Topics Covered**:
- HTTP server creation and routing
- Request handling and response formatting
- Middleware patterns
- JSON APIs and error responses
- Authentication and CORS

**Practice Exercise**:
```bash
make run-backend
# Try the server simulation
```

**Key Takeaways**:
- Go's net/http package is powerful and minimal
- Middleware is function composition
- Error responses should be consistent

### Phase 5: Concurrency (3-4 hours)

#### Step 6: Goroutines & Channels
**Goal**: Master Go's concurrency model

**Topics Covered**:
- Goroutines and lightweight threads
- Channels for communication
- Select statements
- Worker pools and patterns
- Context for cancellation

**Practice Exercise**:
```bash
make run-concurrency
# Try different concurrency patterns
```

**Key Takeaways**:
- "Don't communicate by sharing memory, share memory by communicating"
- Channels are typed and can be directional
- Context is essential for cancellation

## üõ†Ô∏è Hands-On Projects

### Project 1: Simple REST API (Beginner)
Build a basic user management API with:
- GET /users (list users)
- POST /users (create user)
- GET /users/{id} (get user by ID)
- In-memory storage

### Project 2: Concurrent Web Scraper (Intermediate)
Build a web scraper that:
- Scrapes multiple URLs concurrently
- Uses worker pools for rate limiting
- Handles errors gracefully
- Saves results to JSON

### Project 3: Microservice with Database (Advanced)
Build a complete microservice with:
- HTTP API with middleware
- Database integration
- Configuration management
- Health checks and metrics
- Docker containerization

## üìö Code Reading Exercises

### Exercise 1: Trace Through Examples
For each module in the interactive application:
1. Read the code before running it
2. Predict what the output will be
3. Run the code and compare
4. Understand any differences

### Exercise 2: Modify Examples
Take existing examples and:
1. Add new functionality
2. Handle edge cases
3. Improve error messages
4. Add logging or metrics

### Exercise 3: Code Review
Review the source code files:
- `basics/variables.go` - How are different types handled?
- `functions/functions.go` - What error patterns are used?
- `backend/http_server.go` - How is middleware composed?
- `concurrency/goroutines_channels.go` - What concurrency patterns are shown?

## üîç Common Patterns to Master

### Error Handling
```go
if err != nil {
    return fmt.Errorf("operation failed: %w", err)
}
```

### Interface Design
```go
type Storage interface {
    Store(key string, value interface{}) error
    Retrieve(key string) (interface{}, error)
}
```

### Middleware Pattern
```go
func middleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
    return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
        // Before
        next.ServeHTTP(w, r)
        // After
    })
}
```

### Worker Pool
```go
for w := 1; w <= numWorkers; w++ {
    go worker(w, jobs, results)
}
```
